# shinydo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `shinydo` is to guide Shiny craftsmen from “Hello World” to
Shiny software engineering via a practical narrative. It was part of a
`R` and `Shiny` workshop internal to one of my customers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `shinydo` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RudyPastel/shinydo")
```

## How to use shinyDemo

Obviously, you should try the app out.

``` r
shinydo::showPresentation()
```

More importantly however, read, analyse and evaluate the code and its
quality.

Comments, suggestions and customer inquiries are welcome. Contact [Dr
Rudy Pastel](mailto:rudy.pastelgmail.com).
